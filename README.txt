The Game starts with randomly choosing a word from the list using rand function. 
It then shows the user the length of the string and asks user to guess a letter.
If the Guess is correct, the vacant places of the particular letter is filled with that letter
else, the No. of tries left decreases and the user is shown a wrong guess.
The game continues until all 6 wrong guesses are made causing the user to lose or user correctly guesses the word and wins.
If the user input more than one characters or any other character other than english alphabet then also it is considered bad guess.
